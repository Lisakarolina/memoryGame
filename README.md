# Memory Game with Emojis

This is a simple memory game that uses emojis as memory pairs. The cards are filled with  emojis that are created by randomly chosing unicode points. 
When a player uncovers two cards with the same motive, the cards fade out. Cards can be uncovered by manually opening and closing them. 
Alternatively, two open cards are automatically closed when the player tries to open a third card.

At the end of the game, the player is given the opportunity to restart the game - in this case the cards are filled with new random emojis.
